Recommendation and Price Prediction system for used cars on Craiglist

A quantitative study comprising used car sales data scrapped from all over the United States between April to May of 2021

SUMMARY:
The market for used cars has seen growth over the years. During the pandemic, about 61% of car buyers prefered to buy from a dealership.
Over time, the recorded data has shown that the total auto sale of second-hand vehicles has increased two-fold when compared to new car sales in the US
With the number available used vehicles out there, buyers are faced with an abundance of options to choose from. This analysis seeks to understand the historical preferences of buyers and how that can be leveraged to improve the craigslist algorithm to assist buyers and seller alike.

OBJECTIVE:
To improve used car sales listed on craigslist by creating a recommender system to show buyers similar listings to the one they currently view
To create a price prediction model to assist buyers and sellers on a ballpark price to expect for specific models.

Dataset - The used car data was scraped and compiled into one place by a data contributor, Austin Reese, on kaggle website. 

 INSIGHTS

 - Most of the used car listings were found in most of the top 10 most populated states in the US
 - Ford, Chevrolet, and Toyota were the most popular car manufacturers. This is because majority of the listed cars were either sedans, SUVs, trucks or pickups which these manufacturers are known for producing.
 - These top 3 car manufacturers had an average price of ~16k USD, ~1k USD  higher than the total average price of all cars listed in the top 12 states with more than 5000 car listings.
 - On average, pickups and trucks go for ~23k USD, almost 2x that of SUVs and sedans.
 - Since there seems to be a huge market for used luxury cars (sedans and SUVs) the recommendation engine should focus more on these types of cars.
 - California has the most car listings with an average price of ~15k USD which is ~1.5x less than that of Washington state with ~4x less number of car listings.
 - Gas fuel engines is the most occuring type of fuel in all cars except for pickups and trucks which show a considerable split between gas and diesel engine vehicles
 - The majority of the cars have below average miles driven per year. This suggests the cars have not been overworked and can be resolved for good value especially when most of then are either in excellent or good condition.
 - The average price of cars seems relatively higher for newer cars than older cars, but this is affected by other factors such as vintage cars and level of luxury attributed to the model
 - White and black colored cars are the two most popular car colors also having the two highest average prices, ~17.6k USD and ~16.6k USD respectively. Ford and Chevrolet car manufacturers are prevalent in this department.
